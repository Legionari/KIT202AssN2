                        <p class="text" id="post1-body" name="post1-body">A tomahawk steak is every steak lover’s dream.<br> The first time a tomahawk steak was put down in front of me I was filled with a sense of wonder and joy. My first bite was so juicy, meaty, and delicious, it was like all my dreams came true. <br> But it’s also tempered by its equally insane price when served in a steakhouse. If you want all the joy of a tomahawk at only half the cost, you should make it at home (unless it’s a special night out of course). Home-cooked steaks are the best steaks. <br> Tomahawks were a little scary to cook between the high cost and unusually thick cut. Luckily, I did the research so you don’t have to. Read on for the nerdiest tome on how to buy, cook, or serve a perfect tomahawk steak.</p>

This is my go to meal when I don’t know what to eat but I want something fast and quick and flavorful. It’s a riff off of dan dan noodles. Technically it isn’t dan dan mian/dan dan noodles but it technically is too. See, dan dan noodles are one of those dishes, the kind where there are a thousand variations, even in Sichuan, where they’re from. They can come in soup, they can come more dry, they can have pork, they can be vegetarian, they can be whatever you want, really. The beauty of these noodles is: if you can boil noodles and mix sauce in a bowl, you can make these super satisfying spicy noodles.<br> </c>

                        <p class="text" id="post3-body" name="post3-body">Before we get into it, maybe you’re wondering, what the heck is a mochi cookie? It’s a cookie stuffed with mochi, simple as that. In Korea there’s a super popular store bought cookie that’s called Cheongwoo Choco Chip. It’s a double chocolate cookie stuffed with chewy mochi. Since travel to Korea isn’t anywhere in the near future and securing a box online is harder than getting BTS tickets, I decided to make them at home. I took my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe and encased a center of chewy, gooey mochi.<br> This cookie is so good: crisp caramelized edges, pools of melted chocolate puddles, a light sprinkling of salt, and gooey, chewy, soft mochi in the middle.</p>

                        <p class="text" id="post4-body" name="post4-body">Recently Mike found a new-to-us super authentic Mexican place and since he was feeling like burritos we planned to spend the afternoon with some food to go and a little late-summer picnic. He had already decided on a chicken tinga burrito but I was kind of unsure. I have this thing where I’m super indecisive when it comes to food. I always want to make the best decision possible.<br> Anyway, Mike ordered his burrito while I waffled between ALL the other choices. His burrito was ready in a flash and I insisted that he eat it right away – because I wanted to taste it too so I could make an informed decision. One bite and I was sold. It was SO delicious. Huge chunks of juicy chicken in a tomatoey chipotle sauce. The plentiful caramelized onions were sweet and smoky and some diced potatoes added a bit of creaminess. I was ded. I had to recreate it the moment we got home. </p>
